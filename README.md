SelfControlAutomation
=====================

A customized script to automate SelfControl. The original script is due to: http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20100801214648362. I simply modified the time to fit my need and run for 23 hours (1380 minutes) once I activate it.

To automate the script:

1. Export the script as a app from the Apple script editor (I exported it as SelfControlAutomate-23.app)
2. Grab Schedule Daily Task from [here](http://www.sheepsystems.com/products/scheduleDailyTask/) to set up a daily task
3. Configure Schedule Daily Task to run your SelfControl automation app at a given time.
